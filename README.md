# SelfBalancingRobot2018

This self balancing robot started as a side project for three of us to learn a bit about the PID control loop. 
For simplicity, the mechanical part and electronic components of our robot is build using materials from MakeBlock Robotics kit.

We then used Arduino IDE to code our MakeBlock Me_MegaPi microcontroller to control our robot.
